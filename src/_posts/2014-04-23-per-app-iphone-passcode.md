title: Per-App iPhone Passcode

It takes me roughly 1 second to unlock my iPhone, including animation (no, I don’t get nauseous). If you're like most smartphone users, you check your phone about [150 times per day](http://www.slideshare.net/kleinerperkins/kpcb-internet-trends-2013). That's over **15 hours** a year -- assuming you never have to try more than once. That's a small price to pay for a little privacy these days, right?

Assigning passcodes on a per-app basis allocates this frustration to where its needed: banking, general settings, photos, whatever makes you uncomfortable. Maybe that's every app for some people, but for me, I couldn't care less if you picked up my phone and started playing Threes or reading Zite (I'm boycotting the Flipboard acquisition). In fact, I'd rather avoid the "Hey, what's your password?" when a friend wants to borrow my phone for a minute. Time savings on such a minute scale doesn't seem like a big deal, but it adds up and like with any type of tracking -- think Fitbit or Nike FuelBand ([RIP](http://mashable.com/2014/04/22/nike-fuelband-exit-apple/)) -- once you see those numbers accumulating -- 15 hours is insane -- you'll start to feel the burn.

>*"But I would end up locking the same apps that have me checking my phone 150 times per day."*

So it won't save *you* time, but what about the rest of us (OK, maybe just me)? An optional passcode on the lockscreen or a per-app passcode would do the same thing just at different points.  If you continuously check Messages and want to passcode Messages, that passcode would open all other protected apps for the allotted time or until screen lock -- same as now. Then, when you want to search non-sensitive apps quickly like Yelp or look something up in Safari, you're spared the trouble.  Simple? 

>*"But then I have to turn this on for each app I want protected."*

Yep. That's the point: you only have a handful of sensitive apps. Otherwise, lockscreen passcode is your bread and butter. Sorry, if Twitter is sensitive to you this likely won't change your Sunday night "two-screen experience" on Twitter when you pick up your phone every few seconds to #omg and suddenly experience a bout of [bangghorea](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23781044) after every twist on The Walking Dead or when uncle Tony Bourdain eats some pork on Parts Unknown. 

If you jailbreak your iPhone you have some options, [but...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGxwbhkDjZM) As we've seen with iOS7's addition of popular single-purpose utility apps like the flashlight or even gesture and UI features in Mail, Apple isn't shy about picking off the good ideas and making them native.  

### So then why hasn't this feature been getting any love? 
1) It’s a dumb idea or 2) It’s possible that developers have to show Apple the light and begin implementing per-app passcode support much like Dropbox and 1Password have done. I’d be curious to know how many Dropbox users actually set this feature, and I’d bet that number would increase if per-app passcodes were common place and not one-off’s implemented differently in each app. This seems to be right up Apple’s alley: one place, one solution.

This may never happen but let's be honest, if you have a passcode on your phone it's likely because 1) your **stolen** phone is basically stealing a piece of your life/identity 2) your **unattended** phone is basically a window into your personal life.  You probably aren't keen on a significant other scouring your pictures or social profiles (oh wait, I have nothing to hide), or having friends post ridiculous things on your facebook wall (oh wait, I'm not in college anymore), so wouldn't it be equally as <del>immature</del> fun to take a picture of that sneaky wrongdoer in action? Set it at one incorrect entry and fire away. Because how often do you really mistype your passcode. OK, fine, throw it in as a custom setting with a default of one. *Note: this last paragraph isn't serious.*
