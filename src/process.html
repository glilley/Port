<h2>about</h2>
<p>Everyone can solve problems, but designers strategically frame problems to replicate finding solutions for any problem. It’s not always visual, though who doesn’t admire the great work on dribbble, and it’s not always the most creative solution &mdash; yes, parallax effects
can be cool. The best solutions are those that meet strategic goals and provide a holistically well-thought experience. From creative microcopy that provides a human touch at the end of a digital screen to the subtle feedback a user gets from a slight change in color when an input occurs. These are the details I care about. These are the things I appreciate when done well.</p>
<p>My experience is diverse. From political science degree, to financial auditor, and law student, each stop along the way has had one thing in common: I was communicating ideas, a process, a solution. This is what I do now, but in a new medium.</p>

<h2>Huitly case study</h2>
<p>A start-up project
that provides short-term property management and concierge services to airbnb hosts in New York City.</p>

<h2>VISION</h2>
<p>It all starts with an idea, and in this case, an idea sparked out of necessity and recognition of a need. Airbnb hosts were posting ads on TaskRabbit to fulfill services, but were finding the results were subpar and not tailored to their needs.</p>
<h3>objective</h3>
<p>What’s the purpose of the idea? Broadly stated but focused enough to strive for.<br>
Ex: Provide services lacking in New York’s short-term rental property market.</p>
<h3>goal</h3>
<p>What does success look like?<br>Ex: Build a platform that allows busy airbnb users to schedule concierge services for guest bookings in New York City.</p>

<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
<h3>interview</h3>
<p>Live conversations trumped all. Even phone meetings were more informative than email because the best nuggets of new information were extracted from tone, expressions, and untailored responses which hinted at new pain points. Comfort and openness were key.</p>
<h3>ethnographic research (interviews)</h3>
<p>As a customer-facing service, we needed
to see exactly how the hosts were interacting with their guests. We shadowed hosts through entire reservation cycles from booking responses to physical check-in and check-out processes.</p>
<h3>findings</h3>
<p>Roughly 80% of the unknowns at check-in could
be solved with a single well-written and informative email at booking. Also, fewer emails exchanged resulted in better reviews.</p>

<h3>personas</h3>
<p>Referencing imaginary customers
is surprisingly useful, likely because they aren’t so imaginary if done right. Developed largely from assumptions but backed up with all the data we could conjure. Meet Mike and Robin.</p>
<h3>competitive analysis</h3>
<p>Examine closest product’s marketing, management, pricing, strengths
and weaknesses. We used a pseudo-analysis to determine critical success factors and to define what pain points from our personas
were being overlooked.<br><br>Ex: Acquiring a majority of managed-property clients as opposed to one-off services reduces communications errors, provides more value for guests, and improves workforce quality.</p>

<h2>CONCEPT</h2>
<h3>solutions</h3>
<p>A critical success factor is nice to know but how do you achieve it?
Ideate.</p>
<h3>strategy</h3>
<p>Structure ideas into task flows to assess operation cycles. This forces clarity and consideration for each step in the cycle.</p>
<figure class="murally"><img src="/assets/images/murally.png" alt=""><figcaption>operation flows using mural.ly - a collaborative digital whiteboard.</figcaption></figure>
<figure class="postits"><img src="/assets/images/stickies.png" alt=""><figcaption>aligning operations with site content in mural.ly.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>identity</h3>
<p>Utilize personas and service
offerings to create a voice, name, and face. Content should be established before moving on to the purely visual elements or even the wireframes because how you want to sound should ultimately determine how you present the idea.<br><br>We had some placeholder names and even settled on a couple that didn’t have available domain names. It may seem premature to go to these lengths, but as a start-up it provides early legitimacy when pitching to at least have a domain with a company email and logo.</p>

<h2>CREATE</h2>
<h3>wireframe</h3>
<p>Architecture and user flows are loosely sketched for a general idea. Then, Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, or Illustrator are used to clean up and refine the sketches. Based on our personas, a <i>mobile first</i> approach was necessary.</p>
<figure class="huitly-wireframes"><img src="/assets/images/huitly-wireframes.svg" alt=""><figcaption>user flow for account creation and sign in created with illustrator.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>prototype</h3>
<p>Interactions take center stage
as the wireframes are organized and linked together for user testing. Focus is initially on the meat and potatoes - 20% of functions that satisfy 80% of needs. Also, the prototype is void of visual design
to focus on the content and interactions.</p>

<h3>mockup</h3>
<p>High fidelity mockups allow for fine tuning the identity and provide an aesthetic to strive for during the actual build process.</p>
<h3>build</h3>
<p>Huitly’s web app is still under construction, but a live site is available at <a href="http://www.huit.ly">www.Huit.ly</a></p>
<h3>iterate</h3>
<p>Some things don’t work as expected. Your copy isn’t as
clever as you thought because everyone keeps asking what exactly you do or how something works.<br>Well, it’s time to update or improve. We’ve added services to our management model as we’ve recognized the need and to help us achieve our critical success factors.</p>
