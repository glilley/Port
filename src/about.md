Everyone can solve problems, but designers strategically frame problems and apply a process to replicate finding solutions for any problem. It’s not always visual, though who doesn’t admire the great work on [dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com/greglilley), and it’s not always about the newest techniques -- yes, parallax effects can be cool. The best solutions are those that match users' goals and are intuitive because thoughtful communication is the focal point. From creative microcopy that provides a human touch at the end of a digital screen to the organization of information for quickly completing a task, I appreciate the subtleties that enrich an experience.

I studied political science and accounting as an undergrad, worked as a financial auditor, and attended law school. These experiences may seem disconnected, but each stop along the way has shared the same core skills: I was communicating an idea, a process, a solution. This is what I do now, but in a new medium. One a little less boring ;)
