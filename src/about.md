As a product designer, I frame problems by applying a process that uncovers needs and seeks to understand behaviors. It’s not always visual, though who doesn’t admire the great work on [dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com/greglilley), and it’s not always about the snazzy new techniques -- yes, [wild animations](http://www.3dollarmonsters.com) can be cool. The best solutions are those that match users' goals and are 'intuitive' because thoughtful communication is the focal point. From creative microcopy that provides a human touch at the end of a digital screen to the organization of information to quickly complete a task, I appreciate the subtleties that enrich an experience.

I studied political science and accounting as an undergrad, worked tas a financial auditor, and attended law school. These experiences may seem disconnected from my work as a designer, but each stop along the way has shared the same core skills: I was communicating an idea, a process, a solution.
