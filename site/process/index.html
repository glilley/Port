Airbnb hosts were posting ads on TaskRabbit to fulfill check-in and cleaning services, but results were subpar and not tailored to their needs.</p><div><h3>objective</h3><p>At it's core, what is the purpose of the idea? Broadly stated but focused enough to strive for, this creates a launching pad and provides a reference to base early decisions on.<br><br><i>Provide services lacking in New York’s short-term rental property market.</i></p></div><div><h3>goal</h3><p>What does success look like? Yes, this idea is new and there's little research, but defining success in the beginning doesn't mean that it can't or won't change as you learn more. Having an early target to aim for reinforces focus on following the objective and propels the process.<br><br><i>Build a platform that allows busy Airbnb users to schedule concierge services for guest bookings in New York City.</i></p></div></div></div><figure class="inline-image google-doc"><img src=/assets/images/google-doc.png alt="google document showing the beginning thoughts of Huitly's conception."><figcaption>google document of early remote collaboration and idea development.</figcaption></figure></section><section class="container clearfix"><div class=content-format><h2 id=research>RESEARCH</h2><h3>interview</h3><p>The idea was to provide a solution inside of an existing category. Interviews were appropriate because the need was already being broadcasted, but the specifics had to be understood to provide a solution.<br><br><i>Live conversations trumped all. Even phone meetings were more informative than email because the best nuggets of new information were extracted from tone, expressions, and untailored responses which hinted at new pain points. Comfort and openness were key in gaining these insights.</i></p><h3>ethnographic research</h3><p>Serving two sets of clients (our hosts and our hosts' guests), we needed to see how both parties were interacting. We shadowed hosts through entire reservation cycles from booking responses to physical check-in and check-out procedures.<br><br><i>Three hosts were shadowed all roughly within our airbnb target price-per-night range. Understanding a specific segment that we felt made up 80% or more of our customers was an efficient early stage decision.</i></p><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/asana-1.jpg alt="asana screenshot showing our communication of guest intereactions."><figcaption>host-guest interactions tracked in asana during shadowing research and later used for CRM.</figcaption></figure><h3>finding</h3><p><i>Roughly 80% of the unknowns at check-in &mdash; things like directions, events, bag storage, and check-in time &mdash; could be solved with an informative email sent immediately after booking. Also, fewer emails exchanged resulted in better reviews on average. We attributed this to leaving little confusion up front so guests could travel confidently prior to arrival.</i></p><h3>personas</h3><p>Referencing imaginary customers is surprisingly useful, likely because they aren’t so imaginary if done right. Developed largely from assumptions but supported by data from ArcGIS, interviews, and airbnb stats, meet Mike and Robin.</p><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/huitly_personas.png alt="two of the four personas with images and descriptions."><figcaption>two of four personas developed for Huitly.</figcaption></figure><h3>market analysis</h3><p>With few relevant competitors we also looked to traditional property management companies. We determined a set of critical success factors based on what key pain points were being overlooked as identified from interviews and referenced from our personas.<br><br><i>One success factor we recognized later was acquiring a majority of managed properties as opposed to one-off services to reduce communication errors, provide more value for guests, improve workforce quality, and increase revenue.</i></p><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/tapestries.png alt="esri map showing market segmentation."><figcaption>market research with arcgis esri tapestries.</figcaption></figure></div></section><section class="stripe clearfix"><div class=container><div class=content-format><h2 id=concept>CONCEPT</h2><h3>solutions</h3><p>A critical success factor is nice to know but how do you achieve it? Ideate.<br><br><i>Inital thoughts were to provide single services options that hosts could book a la carte. However, this was too cumbersome for our target customer looking to reduce interaction. We began focusing on providing management services to take care of the entire process and then structured our pricing tiers towards management. Single-service packages were developed for those who couldn't meet our monthly booking threshold but wanted to try our service. We hoped this would lead to increased bookings and eventually management service. This hasn't necessarily been true. Also, late guests strained resources so we implemented rules and a lockbox pickup.</i></p><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/murally-1.png alt="screenshot of workflow in mural.ly web app."><figcaption>operation flows using mural.ly, a collaborative digital whiteboard.</figcaption></figure><h3>strategy</h3><p>Structure ideas into task flows to assess operation cycles.

Content should be established before moving on to the purely visual elements or even the wireframes because how you want to sound should ultimately determine how you present the idea.<br><br><i>Personalized, convenient, fresh, trustworthy, and all-inclusive were key words derived from our research that we wanted to portray. To avoid our already bad luck with taken domains we got a little clever and referenced the French word for eight: "huit" &mdash; we were four people, so eight arms worth of help is what you get.</i></p><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/huitly-logos.png alt="early iterations of Huitly's logos."><figcaption>a few steps along the evolution of the Huitly logo.</figcaption></figure><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/huitly_mockup.jpg alt="early iteration of Huitly's landing page."><figcaption>an early landing page mockup to test copy.</figcaption></figure></div><figure><img src=/assets/images/murally-1.png><figcaption>operation flows using mural.ly, a collaborative digital whiteboard.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/assets/images/stickies.png><figcaption>aligning operations with site content in mural.ly.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/assets/images/huitly-logos.png><figcaption>a few steps along the evolution of the Huitly logo.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/assets/images/huitly_mockup.jpg><figcaption>an early landing page mockup to test copy.</figcaption></figure></div></section><section class="container clearfix"><div class=content-format><h2 id=create>CREATE</h2><h3>wireframe</h3><p>Following through with the goal to provide a platform to manage these services, it's time to sketch how we intend to make this happen. Iterations of user flows are scribbled everywhere as new thoughts bounce around. Then, a combination of Balsamiq, Sketch, and Illustrator are used to clean up and refine ideas for more formal feedback (I'm tool agnostic, but Photoshop is pretty low on my totem pole for UI work).<br><br><i>A mobile-first web app aligned with my technical skills (in progress) and desire to be cross platform, which current HTML5 wrappers provide.</i></p><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/sketching.jpg alt="early sketches of mobile web app user dashboard."><figcaption>sketching various layouts for mobile host dashboard.</figcaption></figure><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/huitly-wireframes.svg><figcaption>user flow for account creation and sign-in created with illustrator.</figcaption></figure><h3>prototype</h3><p>Interactions take center stage as the wireframes are organized and linked together for user testing with Balsamiq (in this case). Focus is initially on the meat and potatoes &mdash; 20% of functions that satisfy 80% of needs.<br><br><i>Our key tasks were updating availability and communication between the property manager and host. These would be the most important and useful services for our target customer.<br><br>The prototype is void of visual design to focus on the content placement and interactions. This seemed to lower distraction because the more high fidelity we went, the more opinions we heard about style decisions.</i></p><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/balsamiq-prototype.jpg><figcaption>prototype made with Balsamiq showing a lightbox interaction.</figcaption></figure><h3>mockup</h3><p>High fidelity mockups complete with visual design, solidify the identity, and provide an aesthetic to strive for during the actual build process.</p><br><p><i>Like with most of the previous steps, visual design is not a specific step down the road. It was thought about throughout the research and concept phases and adjusted as findings and goals changed. With a solid foundation, however, it's the visual design that ties the pieces together and gets everyone excited.</i></p><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/huitly-iphone-mockup.png alt="user flow wireframes created in illustrator."><figcaption>illustrator mockups mobile user dashboard.</figcaption></figure><h3>build</h3><p>Huitly’s web app is still under construction, but a live site is available at <a href=http://www.huit.ly>www.Huit.ly</a></p><h3>iterate</h3><p>It's likely that some things don’t work as expected (blame the user! Kidding). Things like your copy not being as clever as you thought because everyone keeps asking what exactly you do or how something works means it's time to adjust. Recycle the steps as far back as necessary.<br><br><i>We’ve added services to our management model that address needs we weren't focusing on the first time around because we were MVP-ing it.</i></p><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/management-services.jpg alt="a selected user flow created in Balsamiq."><figcaption>additional services added to management model.</figcaption></figure><h3>obstacles</h3><p>Well, we wouldn't be a start-up if we didn't have obstacles. We based our services on the back of another platform &mdash; airbnb &mdash; which has the ability to crush us any day and has begun offering services that overlap with ours. Also, being a physical service, achieving scale and maintaining quality control is difficult to manage. Regardless of outcome, there are countless intricacies that were not covered which have taught me what it takes to bring a successful product/service into the world. My desire to design and manage products has only been enhanced by this experience.</p></div><figure><img src=/assets/images/huitly-iphone-mockup.png alt="finished mockup of mobile user dashboard."><figcaption>illustrator mockups mobile user dashboard.</figcaption></figure><figure class=last-image><img src=/assets/images/management-services.jpg alt="a list of management services listed on the Huitly's website."><figcaption>additional services added to management model.</figcaption></figure><div class="download-process clearfix"><a id=pdf href=http://www.gregllly.com/greg-lilley-portfolio.zip alt="download a case study of my process" class="download-icons pdf"><p>process</p></a></div></section></div></div><footer class=home-footer><div class="wrapper clearfix"><a class="social-icon twitter" href=http://www.twitter.com/gregllly alt="Follow me on Twitter"></a> <a class="social-icon dribbble" href=http://www.dribbble.com/greglilley alt="Check out my dribbble profile"></a> <a class="social-icon linkedin" href=http://www.linkedin.com/in/greglilley alt="Check out my LinkedIn profile"></a><p>Greg Lilley &copy 2016</p></div></footer></body></html>
