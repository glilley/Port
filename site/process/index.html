Even phone meetings were more informative than email because the best nuggets of new information were extracted from tone, expressions, and untailored responses which hinted at new pain points. Comfort and openness were key.</p><h3>ethnographic research</h3><p>As a customer-facing service, we needed to see exactly how the hosts were interacting with their guests. We shadowed hosts through entire reservation cycles from booking responses to physical check-in and check-out processes.</p><figure class=inline-image><img src=/assets/images/asana-1.jpg><figcaption>host-guest interactions tracked in asana during shadowing research and later used for CRM.</figcaption></figure><h3>finding</h3><p>Roughly 80% of the unknowns at check-in could be solved with a single well-written and informative email at booking. Also, fewer emails exchanged resulted in better reviews on average.</p><h3>personas</h3><p>Referencing imaginary customers is surprisingly useful, likely because they aren’t so imaginary if done right.
